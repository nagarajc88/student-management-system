Note:
1. In Micro service we have the following microservices
   a) service-registry: which we need to start first and this will handle all our instances. using eureka.
   b) Next need to start CloudConfigServer instance this is the one handle all common configuration files using in all instances.
   c) Next we have need to run individual instances example (department service, employee service, auth service etc..).
   d) Finally we need to Cloud-gateway service.
2. The main purpose of this microservices application is to create architecture of microservice for our student management system.
3. Still it is in development stage we need to work other microservice instances.
4. we are using JDK V21 to run this microservice architecture.
